# Lab 2 Instrutions
---

### Submission

-   Delete your `node_modules` folder.
-   Delete your `dist` folder.
-   Ensure your full name and student number are in the author field of your `package.json`.
-   Ensure your `README.md` has specific instructions on how to run your application.
-   Your lab writeup should be in `src/2_lab_solution.md` (or something of the sort).
    -   Ensure there is a link in your header that points to your writeup so I can easily see it.
-   Delete your .env file, or any references to any API keys that are for "public" CMS systems.
-   Zip up all of your remaining files, name the zip with your last name and first initial, ie `kunza.zip`.
-   Put it in the dropbox before the due date.
  
### Instructions

-   Document and justify technology choices for Assignment 2.

-   Read and write about 5 headless CMS systems. Strapi, Contentful, Sanity, Prismic, and Ghost are good options, but you are not limited to these. Choose two or three to practice with and explain why you picked those ones.

-   Try to implement some of these different systems into your site.  It might be a good idea to make a few copies of your site and implement each CMS in a different copy.  Do some experimentation to decide which one you'd like to use in your final product, and explain why you made that choice. 

-   Provide some proof of this work in your submission, either via screenshots, code samples, videos, or whatever else you think will show to me (and future employers) that you can do a little bit of R&D. I am not looking for specific screenshots.  You are telling me the story of your research, and you're using screenshots to help explain your journey.

-   The submission will be embedded in your "project so far".  You may use markdown as before (please read the markdown instructions carefully), or you may use whichever template engine you've chosen.  There must be a link to your submission in your header (or some other very obvious spot on the page).
